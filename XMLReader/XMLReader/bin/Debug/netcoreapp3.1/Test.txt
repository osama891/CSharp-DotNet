An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock you should also refer to the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements financial statements and the related notes.Risks Related to Our Business BusinessWe have had a history of losses.We experienced net losses of $6.7 million for 2006, $9.1 million for 2007, and $5.4 million for 2008. In the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we achieved profitability and reported net income for the first time. We cannot predict if we will sustain this profitability or, if we fail to sustain this profitability, again attain profitability in the near future or at all. We expect to continue making significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business business. In addition, as a public company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These increased expenditures make it harder for us to achieve and maintain future profitability. Our recent growth in revenue and customer base may not be sustainable, and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this prospectus, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business business and future prospects.Our company has been in existence since 2003, and much of our growth has occurred in recent periods. Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing expenses as we continue to grow our business business. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business business will be harmed.Our business is substantially dependent on market demand for, and acceptance of, the on-demand model for the use of software.We derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from the sale of on-demand solutions, a relatively new and rapidly changing market. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of theon-demandbusiness model is critical to our future growth and success. Under the perpetual or periodic license model for software procurement, users of the software typically run applications on their hardware. Because companies are generally predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to the concept of accessing the functionality that software provides as a service through a third party. If the market for on-demand software solutions fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our services could be negatively affected.Growth of our business business may be adversely affected if businesses, IT support providers or consumers do not adopt remote access or remote support solutions more widely.Our services employ new and emerging technologies for remote access and remote support. Our target customers may hesitate to accept the risks inherent in applying and relying on new technologies or methodologies to supplant traditional methods of remote connectivity. Our business business will not be successful if our target customers do not accept the use of our remote access and remote support technologies.8Adverse economic conditions or reduced IT spending may adversely impact our revenues.Our business depends on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The use of our service is often discretionary and may involve a commitment of capital and other resources. Weak economic conditions, or a reduction in IT spending even if economic conditions improve, would likely adversely impact our business business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways, including by lengthening sales cycles, lowering prices for our services and reducing sales.Failure to renew or early termination of our service and marketing agreement with Intel would adversely impact our revenues.In December 2007, we entered into a service and marketing agreement with Intel Corporation to jointly develop and market a service that delivers connectivity to computers built with Intel components. Under the terms of this four-year agreement, we are adapting our service delivery platform, Gravity, to work with specific technology delivered with Intel hardware and software products. If we are unable to renew our agreement with Intel after the initial four-year term on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our revenue would decrease. In addition, the agreement grants Intel early termination rights in certain circumstances, such as a failure of the parties to exceed certain minimum revenue levels after the second and third years of the agreement. If Intel exercises any of its early termination rights, even after Intel's payment of required early termination fees, our revenues would decrease.Assertions by a third party that our services infringe its intellectual property, whether or not correct, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses. We have recently been named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging patent infringement.There is frequent litigation in the software and technology industries based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly visible as a publicly-traded company, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us may grow. During 2007 and 2008, we were a defendant in three patent infringement lawsuits and paid approximately $2.8 million to settle these lawsuits. We also recently learned that a complaint had been filed against us by PB&J Software, LLC, alleging that we have infringed on one of their patents relating to a particular application or system for transferring or storingback-upcopies of files from one computer to a second computer. While the complaint has not been served on us and we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims, we could be required to spend significant resources investigating and defending this claim. In addition, any adverse determination or settlement of this claim could prevent us from offering a portion of our services or require us to pay damages or license fees.In addition, although we have licensed proprietary technology, we cannot be certain that the owners' rights in such technology will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, many of our service agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.Any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services, require us to pay damages, require us to obtain a license or require that we stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights or procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe, which could require significant resources and expenses.We depend on search engines to attract a significant percentage of our customers, and if those search engines change their listings or increase their pricing, it would limit our ability to attract new customers.Many of our customers locate our website through search engines, such as Google. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings, and we rely on both types. Algorithmic9listings cannot be purchased and are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize search result listings. If the search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms in a manner that reduces the prominence of our listing, fewer potential customers may click through to our website, requiring us to resort to other costly resources to replace this traffic. Any failure to replace this traffic could reduce our revenue and increase our costs. In addition, costs for purchased listings have increased in the past and may increase in the future, and further increases could have negative effects on our financial condition.If we are unable to attract new customers to our services on a cost-effective basis, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.We must continue to attract a large number of customers on a cost-effective basis, many of whom have not previously used on-demand, remote-connectivity solutions. We rely on a variety of marketing methods to attract new customers to our services, such as paying providers of online services and search engines for advertising space and priority placement of our website in response to Internet searches. Our ability to attract new customers also depends on the competitiveness of the pricing of our services. If our current marketing initiatives are not successful or become unavailable, if the cost of such initiatives were to significantly increase, or if our competitors offer similar services at lower prices, we may not be able to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis and, as a result, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.If we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.We sell our services pursuant to agreements that are generally one year in duration. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and these subscriptions may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to grow depends in part on subscription renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers' spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed.If we fail to convert our free users to paying customers, our revenue and financial results will be harmed.A significant portion of our user base utilizes our services free of charge through our free services or free trials of our premium services. We seek to convert these free and trial users to paying customers of our premium services. If our rate of conversion suffers for any reason, our revenue may decline and our business business may suffer.We use a limited number of data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business business.We host our services and serve all of our customers from three third-party data center facilities, of which two are located in the United States and one is located in Europe. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.Our data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. At least one of our data facilities is located in an area known for seismic activity, increasing our susceptibility to the risk that an earthquake could significantly harm the operations of these facilities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism,10vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.If the security of our customers' confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to liability and a loss of customers.Our system stores our customers' confidential information, including credit card information and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are difficult to recognize and react to. We and our third-party data center facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether successful or not, would harm our reputation, and it could cause the loss of customers.Failure to comply with data protection standards may cause us to lose the ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option which would increase our costs of processing customer orders and make our services less attractive to our customers, the majority of which purchase our services with a credit card.Major credit card issuers have adopted data protection standards and have incorporated these standards into their contracts with us. If we fail to maintain our compliance with the data protection and documentation standards adopted by the major credit card issuers and applicable to us, these issuers could terminate their agreements with us, and we could lose our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option. Most of our individual and SMB customers purchase our services online with a credit card, and our business business depends substantially upon our ability to offer the credit card payment option. Any loss of our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option would make our services less attractive to them and hurt our business business. Our administrative costs related to customer payment processing would also increase significantly if we were not able to accept credit card payments for our services.Failure to effectively and efficiently service SMBs would adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue.We market and sell a significant amount of our services to SMBs. SMBs are challenging to reach, acquire and retain in a cost-effective manner. To grow our revenue quickly, we must add new customers, sell additional services to existing customers and encourage existing customers to renew their subscriptions. Selling to, and retaining SMBs is more difficult than selling to and retaining large enterprise customers because SMB customers generally:• have high failure rates;• are price sensitive;• are difficult to reach with targeted sales campaigns;• have high churn rates in part because of the scale of their businesses and the ease of switching services; and• generate less revenues per customer and per transaction.In addition, SMBs frequently have limited budgets and may choose to spend funds on items other than our services. Moreover, SMBs are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies, and if these organizations experience economic hardship, they may be unwilling or unable to expend resources on IT.11If we are unable to market and sell our services to SMBs with competitive pricing and in a cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue quickly and become profitable will be harmed.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new services, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.The on-demand, remote-connectivity solutions market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing services, introduce new services and sell into new markets. To achieve market acceptance for our services, we must effectively anticipate and offer services that meet changing customer demands in a timely manner. Customers may require features and capabilities that our current services do not have. If we fail to develop services that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew our services with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our services will be harmed.We may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new services and enhancements. The introduction of new services by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing service offerings could render our existing or future services obsolete. If our services become obsolete due to wide-spread adoption of alternative connectivity technologies such as other Web-based computing solutions, our ability to generate revenue may be impaired. In addition, any new markets into which we attempt to sell our services, including new countries or regions, may not be receptive.If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new services, enhance our existing services to anticipate and meet customer preferences or sell our services into new markets, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.The market in which we participate is competitive, with low barriers to entry, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results may be harmed.The markets for remote-connectivity solutions are competitive and rapidly changing, with relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance. Often we compete against existing services that our potential customers have already made significant expenditures to acquire and implement.Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower priced, or free, products or services that compete with our solutions. This competition may result in reduced prices and a substantial loss of customers for our solutions or a reduction in our revenue.We compete with Citrix Systems, WebEx (a division of Cisco Systems) and others. Certain of our solutions, including our free remote access service, also compete with current or potential services offered by Microsoft and Apple. Many of our actual and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. If we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.Industry consolidation may result in increased competition.Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than they individually had offered. In addition,12new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. Many of the companies driving this trend have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary services and technologies. The companies resulting from such combinations may create more compelling service offerings and may offer greater pricing flexibility than we can or may engage in business business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. These pressures could result in a substantial loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues.Original equipment manufacturers may adopt solutions provided by our competitors.Original equipment manufacturers may in the future seek to build the capability for on-demand, remote-connectivity solutions into their products. We may compete with our competitors to sell our services to, or partner with, these manufacturers. Our ability to attract and partner with these manufacturers will, in large part, depend on the competitiveness of our services. If we fail to attract or partner with, or our competitors are successful in attracting or partnering with, these manufacturers, our revenue and results of operations would be affected adversely.Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below:• our ability to renew existing customers, increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation, maintenance and expansion of our business business;• service outages or security breaches;• whether we meet the service level commitments in our agreements with our customers;• changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;• the timing and success of new application and service introductions and upgrades by us or our competitors;• changes in sales compensation plans or organizational structure;• the timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies, services or businesses;• seasonal variations or other cyclicality in the demand for our services;• general economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to Internet usage and online businesses;• the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;• the financial condition of our customers; and• geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist acts.We believe that our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.13If our services are used to commit fraud or other similar intentional or illegal acts, we may incur significant liabilities, our services may be perceived as not secure and customers may curtail or stop using our services.Our services enable direct remote access to third-party computer systems. We do not control the use or content of information accessed by our customers through our services. If our services are used to commit fraud or other bad or illegal acts, such as posting, distributing or transmitting any software or other computer files that contain a virus or other harmful component, interfering or disrupting third-party networks, infringing any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy, transmitting any unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, vulgar or otherwise objectionable material, or accessing unauthorized third-party data, we may become subject to claims for defamation, negligence, intellectual property infringement or other matters. As a result, defending such claims could be expensive and time-consuming, and we could incur significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses who were the targets of such acts. As a result, our business business may suffer and our reputation will be damaged.We provide minimum service level commitments to some of our customers, our failure of which to meet could cause us to issue credits for future services or pay penalties, which could significantly harm our revenue.Some of our customer agreements now, and may in the future, provide minimum service level commitments regarding items such as uptime, functionality or performance. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments for these customers or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our service, we are or may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future services or pay other penalties. Our revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to meet our service level commitments and are required to provide a significant amount of our services at no cost or pay other penalties. We do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.We increased our number of full-time employees from 126 at December 31, 2006, to 209 at December 31, 2007, to 287 at December 31, 2008 and to 303 at March 31, 2009, and our revenue increased from $11.3 million in 2006, to $27.0 million in 2007, to $51.7 million in 2008 and was $17.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business business, customer base, headcount and operations both domestically and internationally. Creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter.If we do not effectively expand and train our work force, our future operating results will suffer.We plan to continue to expand our work force both domestically and internationally to increase our customer base and revenue. We believe that there is significant competition for qualified personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our recruiting, training and retention efforts are not successful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, our business business will be harmed.14Our sales cycles for enterprise customers, currently approximately 10% of our overall sales, can be long, unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.The timing of our revenue from sales to enterprise customers is difficult to predict. These efforts require us to educate our customers about the use and benefit of our services, including the technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. Enterprise customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past resulted in a lengthy sales cycle, typically several months. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our enterprise sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, service subscriptions are frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our results could fall short of public expectations and our business business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our services to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.We currently maintain offices and have sales personnel or independent consultants outside of the United States and are attempting to expand our international operations. In November 2007, we opened our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales and marketing headquarters in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and in January 2009, we opened our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing headquarters in Sydney, Australia. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States.These risks include:• localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;• lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;• longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;• difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;• fluctuations in currency exchange rates;• potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added or other tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;• dependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;• the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;• political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and• reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.Operating in international markets also requires significant management management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.Our success depends on our customers' continued high-speed access to the Internet and the continued reliability of the Internet infrastructure.Because our services are designed to work over the Internet, our revenue growth depends on our customers' high-speed access to the Internet, as well as the continued maintenance and development of the15Internet infrastructure. The future delivery of our services will depend on third-party Internet service providers to expand high-speed Internet access, to maintain a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, and to develop complementary products and services, including high-speed modems, for providing reliable and timely Internet access and services. The success of our business business depends directly on the continued accessibility, maintenance and improvement of the Internet as a convenient means of customer interaction, as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees. All of these factors are out of our control.To the extent that the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or bandwidth requirements, the Internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it, and its performance or reliability may decline. Any future Internet outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our customers.Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.We rely on a combination of copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. In addition, we have four patents pending, and we are in the process of filing additional patents. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our successful legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.Our use of "open source" software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.A portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporate so-called "open source" software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source softwareand/orthat we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services.16We rely on third-party software, including server software and licenses from third parties to use patented intellectual property that is required for the development of our services, which may be difficult to obtain or which could cause errors or failures of our services.We rely on software licensed from third parties to offer our services, including server software from Microsoft and patented third-party technology. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use intellectual property associated with the development of our services, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software required for the development and maintenance of our services could result in delays in the provision of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business business. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our services which could harm our business business.If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business business and investors' views of us.Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently. Our internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In connection with this offering, we intend to begin the process of documenting, reviewing and improving our internal controls over financial reporting for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require an annual management management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report from our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Both we and our independent registered public accounting firm will be attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in connection with our second filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission after becoming a public company. As part of our process of documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify areas for further attention and improvement. We have begun recruiting additional finance and accounting personnel with skill sets that we will need as a public company.Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business business. In addition, investors' perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for us to effectively market and sell our services to new and existing customers.Material defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services.The software applications underlying our services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our services, and new errors in our existing services may be detected in the future. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in:• a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our services;• sales credits or refunds to our customers;• loss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers;17• diversion of development resources;• harm to our reputation; and• increased insurance costs.After the release of our services, defects or errors may also be identified from time to time by our internal team and by our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our services may be substantial and could harm our operating results.Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce and of the international exchange of certain technologies is subject to possible unfavorable changes, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business business and operating results.As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers' ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In addition, taxation taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the Internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the Internet and could diminish the viability of our Internet-based services, which could harm our business business and operating results.Our software products contain encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign countries, restrictions on importationand/oruse. We have submitted our encryption products for technical review under U.S. export regulations and have advised U.S. export enforcement authorities that our encryption software products were made available for international distribution from ourU.S.-basedfacilities without first completing this required review procedure. This or any other failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, which could harm our business business and operating results. Foreign regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies that we seek for improving our products and services and may also limit or reduce the demand for our products and services outside of the United States.Our operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our subscription services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.Primarily due to the nature of our services in certain states and countries, we do not believe we are required to collect sales or other related taxes from our customers in certain states or countries. However, one or more other states or countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us or our resellers and other partners. A successful assertion that we should be collecting sales or other related taxes on our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our services or otherwise harm our business business and operating results.We may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert OUR MANAGEMENTOUR MANAGEMENT's attention, result in additional dilution dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business business.Although we have no ongoing negotiations or current agreements or commitments for any acquisitions, our business business strategy may include acquiring complementary services, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our portfolio of services or our ability to provide our services in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to18conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.An acquisition, investment or new business business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company's software is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business business due to changes in management management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business business, divert our resources and require significant management management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. For one or more of those transactions, we may:• issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;• use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business business;• incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;• incur large charges or substantial liabilities;• encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business business cultures; and• become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.Any of these risks could harm our business business and operating results.The loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel may impair our ability to grow our business business.We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management management team and key technical and sales personnel, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer. These officers are not party to an employment agreement with us, and they may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of these officers likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of these officers may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business business objectives.We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, software and manufacturing companies. For example, our competitors may be able attract and retain a more qualified engineering team by offering more competitive compensation packages. If we are unable to attract new engineers and retain our current engineers, we may not be able to develop and maintain our services at the same levels as our competitors and we may, therefore, lose potential customers and sales penetration in certain markets. Our failure to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business business plan and, as a result, our ability to compete would decrease, our operating results would suffer and our revenues would decrease.Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of our Common StockWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.As a public company, we will incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the exchange on which we list our shares of common stock issued in this offering. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically. We expect these rules and regulations to19substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage previously available. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.Our failure to raise additional capital or generate the cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in our services could reduce our ability to compete successfully.We may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:• develop or enhance our services;• continue to expand our development, sales and marketing organizations;• acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;• expand our operations, in the United States or internationally;• hire, train and retain employees; or• respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.An active trading market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price.Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock has been approved for listing on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. The initial public offering price of our common stock was determined through negotiations between us and the underwriters underwriters. This initial public offering price may not be indicative of the market price of our common stock after the offering. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the initial public offering price or at the time that they would like to sell.Our stock price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock after this offering may drop below the price you pay.The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations after this offering, and it may decline below the initial public offering price. Market prices for securities of early stage companies have historically been particularly volatile. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the initial public offering price. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:• fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;• fluctuations in our recorded revenue, even during periods of significant sales order activity;• changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;• failure of any of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance;• changes in market valuations of similar companies;20• success of competitive products or services;• changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;• announcements by us or our competitors of significant services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;• regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;• litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;• additions or departures of key personnel;• general perception of the future of the remote-connectivity market or our services;• investors' general perception of us; and• changes in general economic, industry and market conditions.In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management management.A significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business business is doing well.Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time after the expiration of thelock-upagreements described in the "Underwriting Underwriting" section of this prospectus. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. After this offering, we will have 21,383,301 shares of common stock outstanding based on the number of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2009. This includes the 5,000,000 shares that we are selling and the 1,666,667 shares that the selling stockholders selling stockholders are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 14,716,634 shares, representing 68.8% of our outstanding shares after this offering, are currently restricted as a result of securities laws orlock-upagreements but will be able to be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws, in the near future as set forth below.Number of Shares and First Date Available for% of Total Outstanding Sale into Public Market0 shares, or 0% On the date of this prospectus0 shares, or 0% 90 days after the date of this prospectus14,716,634 shares, or 68.8% 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to extension in specified instances, due to lock-up agreements between the holders of these shares and the underwriters underwriters; however, the representatives of the underwriters underwriters can waive the provisions of these lock-up agreements and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any timeIn addition, as of May 31, 2009, there were 3,206,450 shares subject to outstanding options that will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, thelock-upagreements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Moreover, after this offering, holders of an aggregate of approximately 9.9 million shares of our common stock as of May 31, 2009, will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also intend to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity incentive plans,21including 832,982 shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, including our 2009 stock incentive plan, which we adopted in June 2009 and will be effective upon the closing of this offering. Once we register and issue these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to thelock-upagreements.Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution dilution in the book value of their investment.The initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock immediately after this offering. Therefore, if you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate dilution dilution of $12.49 in net tangible book value per share from the price you paid. In addition, following this offering, purchasers in the offering will have contributed 72.5% of the total consideration paid by our stockholders to purchase shares of common stock. Moreover, we issued options in the past to acquire common stock at prices significantly below the initial public offering price. As of May 31, 2009, 3,206,450 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $4.27 per share. To the extent that these outstanding options are ultimately exercised, you will incur further dilution dilution. For a further description of the dilution dilution that you will experience immediately after this offering, see the "Dilution Dilution" section of this prospectus.If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.OUR MANAGEMENT will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment.OUR MANAGEMENT will have broad discretion to use our net proceeds from this offering, and you will be relying on the judgment of OUR MANAGEMENTOUR MANAGEMENT regarding the application of these proceeds. OUR MANAGEMENTOUR MANAGEMENT might not apply our net proceeds of this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment. We expect to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes and working capital, which may in the future include investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies. OUR MANAGEMENTOUR MANAGEMENT might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from this offering.After the completion of this offering, we do not expect to declare any dividends dividends in the foreseeable future.After the completion of this offering, we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends dividends should not purchase our common stock.22Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:• authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;• limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;• limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;• requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;• providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;• limiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and• providing that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in OUR MANAGEMENTOUR MANAGEMENT.As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.23
